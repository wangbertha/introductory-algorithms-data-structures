# Introductory Algorithms in JavaScript

BinarySearch: With iterative approach

BinarySearchRecursive: With recursive approach

BinarySearchTree: Initialized as an empty tree

DynamicArray: Doubles in capacity when initial capacity is reached, and halves in capacity when size reaches a quarter of capacity

HashArray: Uses open addressing to resolve collisions

QueueArray: Uses array data structure

QueueLinkedList: Uses LinkedList data structure

SinglyLinkedList: Each Node only references the next Node
